# Pandemic Data Room
## A Resource Provided by The Center for Global Data Visualization

The Pandemic Data Room is a comprehensive global COVID-19 data repository created by a consortium of partners and led by QED Group to improve understanding of the impact of physical distancing policies on social behavior, disease rates, hospital utilization, and local/national economies. This initiative will generate critical information needed to adjust policies to control the outbreak. We hope to bring amazing talent to work on the data and generate new tools that can be used to manage and understand this pandemic.

In order that the Pandemic Data Room best reflects questions being asked among the global health and international development communities, we have created a portal where people can pose questions on COVID-19 they are looking to get answered. This question portal will be available to Data Challenge  participants and they can use it to generate ideas in creating compelling visualization and analysis tools. Please visit the portal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q-OpRV6bvZuePvF1E_DSwTr121zPoIZExkiozWw1-24/edit).  



Participate in the <a href="https://cgdv.github.io/challenges/COVID-19/" target="_blank">COVID-19 Data Challenge</a> using this data resource. Both students and professionals are encouraged to participate. For each track, submissions are judged separately and prizes (1st Place $2000, 2nd Place $1500, 3rd Place $1000, Honorable Mentions $100) are awarded. 

Contribute to the Pandemic Data Room by submitting a new data source request in this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn74SkcHp3lJ6rv2QTU1VmeliwUe_d6G8H_dFvVf_J_LEeMQ/viewform). We will evaluate your data source and get back to you soon!

<a href="//www.idsinternational.com">IDS International and Clear Outcomes</a>: Survey Data on Physical Distancing and Hygiene Behaviors in the United States</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Detailed Description: Flattening the curve depends on the population following policies on physical distancing (e.g., staying home, avoiding contact closer than 6’) and hygiene (e.g., washing hands, wearing masks). Getting back to work depends on measuring the effectiveness of policies and behaviors so that governments, institutions, businesses, and individuals can make better decisions on what can be done without triggering new outbreaks. IDS is a data and technology company working to create data collection and analysis tools to better measure compliance and effectiveness of pandemic behavior safety.  
On April 6th, 2020, IDS conducted an online survey among a nationally representative sample about Physical Distancing and Hygiene Behaviors. See and download latest results of IDS's nationwide poll, summary for survey results and survey questions <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MWuEBU9a7Z9ShqZKCmNeGZn4yDMdDje5M7RT2E6G54/edit">here</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li> Detailed Description: The risks posed by coronavirus are especially high for millions of people who live in low-and middle-income countries, where financial, medical equipment, and health personnel resources are highly constrained. 
To rapidly identify countries, cities and communities that exhibit the greatest risk of emergency cases and rapid transmission, Fraym provides access to relevant data layers including Emergency Case Risk Factors (Smoking prevalence, Elderly households, Body health - obesity, child stunting, child wasting) and Transmission Risk Factors (Population density, Household size, Occupation, Transportation modes, Hand Washing Practices).
CGDV has requested the above data layers for countries including Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa. Each folder should have a data dictionary and a citation guide for use.

## Social Data

<details>
<summary>
<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">Google Trends</a>: Data on the trends in people's google searches.</summary>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Detailed Description: GoogleTrends data is phenomenal, it is interesting, important, and can be so insightful, IF IT IS USED CORRECTLY. It can be a little confusing the first time you see it, and the instructions given will help you understand the graphs presented on the GoogleTrends page when you input a search term. However, figuring out how to use it further and get more from it, is not super clear. All of the data is given in search intensity, scaled from 0 to 100, where 100 is the maximum search intensity. The maximum search intensity does not give you any information about the actual number of searches, that number is that search terms peak in searches, then everything else is scaled to that value. A search intensity of 50 means that term was searched half as many times as the search intensity of 100. 

Now, lets put that in context, google trends allows you to vary the time period, regional resolution, and the search term(s).
    - You can specify a time period of any range dating back to 2014.
        - Time periods of less than a week will return hourly data
        - Time periods over a week, but less than 269 days (about 9 months, but using 8 is safe) returns daily data
        - Time periods over 269 days return weekly data
    - You can choose the whole world or a specific country
        - The whole world will give you country level comparisons
        - Different countries have different levels you can compare from, for example U.S. has a default of comparing states, but you can also choose to compare by metro region.


Let's start with relative search intensities (i.e. comparing different searches):
    - You will specify a time period, and what is returned may be hourly, daily or weekly search intensities.
    - Only one term is going to reach 100 over that time period. This represents the highest search intensity for that term, and any of the other terms you are comparing.
    - Then every other search intensity is scaled from that point. No matter what term you are looking at in a relative search intensity on GoogleTrends it's search intensity = # searches for that term / # searches at the peak search intensity (100)
    - GoogleTrends allows you to compare up to five words or phrases at one time. There are ways to overlap time periods and search terms together to get a pretty good estimate to compare from, but DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. It is very difficult, and a tiny mistake makes all of your data innaccurate.

Regional Search Intensities (comparing a terms search intensity based on location):
    - You enter a search term and you can specify whether it is the whole world, or one particular country.
    - GoogleTrends gives you colored maps representing this data.
    - What the actual data has for you is similar to the relative search intensities.
    - Only one region in the region and time period you specified will be reach 100.
    - The rest of the regions are scaled the same way as relative search intensity to that moment and regions search intensity

*** You can also do regional searches that compare multiple terms, and it is really interesting. However, manipulation of that data is even more difficult, and requires a lot of attention to unravel. It is very easy to make a small mistake, and that small mistake will echo throughout all of the data, again making it worthless.

This is just a brief summary of the data given, and what I have found to be the things to watch out for, look at google trends descriptions as well for details specific to their user interface. If you still feel like you want to dive deeper into some of this data, there is a library full of research articles using the data and webpages dedicated to some manipulation of the data to get more out of it. I will just warn you to be careful, the manipulation, overlapping and other methods to change the data are always approximations, and not always correct, so read them thoughourly and check that they validated their method in some clear and accurate way.</li>

<a href="https://covid-survey.dataforgood.fb.com/"> Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Center</a>: Self-reported descriptions of COVID-19-related symptoms - Added April 20</summary>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Detailed Description: The survey from CMU Delphi Research Center asks people to self-report symptoms associated with COVID-19 or the flu that they or anyone in their household has experienced in the last 24 hours. Data are gathered nationwide with the help of Facebook and Google. High correlation between self-reported descriptions of COVID-19-related symptoms and test-confirmed cases of the disease suggests self-reports might soon help the researchers in forecasting COVID-19 activity.
<br>
<br>Delphi COVID-19 Response Team develops API for accessing the Delphi's COVID-19 Surveillance Streams (covidcast) data source of the Delphi's epidemiological data. COVIDcast displays signals related to COVID-19 activity levels across the United States, derived from a variety of anonymized, aggregated data sources made available by multiple partners.
Each signal may reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, mild symptoms, or more severe disease over time. Each signal can be presented at multiple geographic resolutions: state, county, and/or metropolitan area. All these signals taken together may suggest heightened or rising COVID-19 activity in specific locations.
